CLASS IMBALANCE ANALYSIS
==============================================================================

MOST OVERREPRESENTED TEETH (>5.0%):
  1. Tooth 47 (Lower Right 2nd Molar):    181 instances (5.80%)
  2. Tooth 46 (Lower Right 1st Molar):    174 instances (5.57%)
  3. Tooth 37 (Lower Left 2nd Molar):     169 instances (5.41%)
  4. Tooth 45 (Lower Right 2nd Premolar): 164 instances (5.25%)

MOST UNDERREPRESENTED TEETH (<2.0%):
  1. Tooth 18 (Upper Right 3rd Molar):     41 instances (1.31%)
  2. Tooth 28 (Upper Left 3rd Molar):      43 instances (1.38%)
  3. Tooth 31 (Lower Left 1st Incisor):    60 instances (1.92%)

CLASS IMBALANCE RATIO:
  Max/Min: 181/41 = 4.41x
  (Tooth 47 is 4.41 times more common than Tooth 18)

BALANCED EXPECTATION:
  Perfect balance per tooth: 3122 / 32 = 97.56 instances
  Standard deviation: 35.47

REDISTRIBUTION IMPACT (Testing → Training/Validation)
==============================================================================

STRATEGIC IMPROVEMENTS:
✓✓ Underrepresented teeth prioritized for Validation set
   - Tooth 31: +13 instances in Validation (37→60 total, 35% improvement)
   - Tooth 32: +18 instances in Validation (39→68 total, 74% improvement)
   - Tooth 41: +16 instances in Validation (40→67 total, 68% improvement)
   - Tooth 42: +16 instances in Validation (43→69 total, 60% improvement)
   - Tooth 43: +13 instances in Validation (52→85 total, 64% improvement)
   - Tooth 33: +18 instances in Validation (52→86 total, 65% improvement)

✓ Balanced distribution maintained
   - Training: 616 images, 2545 instances (81.5%)
   - Validation: 136 images, 577 instances (18.5%)
   - Testing: 0 images [Ready for external dataset]

✓ Validation set now better represents underrepresented classes
   - Lower incisors (31, 32, 41, 42): significantly improved
   - Critical for unbiased evaluation metrics

==============================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TRAINING
==============================================================================

1. WEIGHTED LOSS FUNCTION:
   Apply inverse frequency weighting to balance gradients:
   - Teeth 18, 28: weight = 2.4x
   - Teeth 31, 32, 41, 42: weight = 1.4x
   - Teeth 45, 46, 47: weight = 0.6x
   - Tooth 37: weight = 0.5x

2. DATA AUGMENTATION:
   Focus augmentation on underrepresented classes:
   - Teeth 18, 28 (wisdom teeth): augment 2-3x
   - Teeth 31, 41 (lower incisors): augment 1.5x

3. SAMPLING STRATEGY:
   Consider oversampling images containing rare teeth during training

4. EVALUATION:
   Report per-class metrics (precision, recall, F1) to identify biases
   Pay special attention to performance on teeth 18, 28, 31
